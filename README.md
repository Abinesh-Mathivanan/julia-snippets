# Julia 1.0+ Code Snippets

Efficiently write and navigate through code with ease using this comprehensive collection of code snippets for Julia.

## Commands

* `jl-count0bits`: returns the no of 0 bits of an integer.
* `jl-count1bits`: returns the no of 1 bits of an integer.
* `jl-binsearch`: returns the index of the target element in an sorted array. If not found, returns -1.
* `jl-insertionsort`: sorts the array using insertion sort method.
* `jl-appendarr`: appends two arrays.
* `jl-searcharr`: returns the index of the target element using linear search.
* `jl-BFS`: Implements Breadth First Searching Algorithm.
* `jl-DFS`: Implements Depth First Searching Algorithm.
* `jl-A*`: Implements A* Searching Algorithm.
* `jl-dijkstras`: Implements Dijkstras Algorithm to determine the shortest path between two nodes.
* `jl-sieveofatkin`: returns the list of primes to the given range using the sieve of atkin method.

## Known Issues

No known issues so far. Functions are working perfectly fine. The code definitions might be confusing for some people, currently working on it to simplify the definitions.

## Release Notes

### 0.0.1

The current version `0.0.1`, comprises of the snippets for basic array, string, bitmasking, searching and sorting operations and other commonly used snippets in general problem solving. Additionally, we have included the prime theorems, graph traversals and searching algorithms, linkedlists, stacks and queues. We're working to add more data structures, parallel computing & AI & DL Snippets in the upcoming versions.
